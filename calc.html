    <h4>Crafting from home is a great way to express your
      creativity and even generate income. The creation of apps and websites like
      Etsy and Facebook Marketplace have made it easier than ever for crafters to
      list and market their products. However, how do you figure out how to price
      your items? What goes into calculating a fair price? How much should you pay
      yourself? With <u>The Crafty Calculator</u>, all of those questions will be answered.
      Enter your information below and click Calculate to see your results!</h4>

        <h3><u>Does this price seem too high?</u></h3>
          Keep in mind that this calculator only serves as an estimate for pricing your crafts.
          If the price seems too high, consider a few things:<br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>What are the biggest factors contributing to the cost? (Usually it's cost of
              materials or amount of time.)</li>
            <li>Can you find more affordable raw materials elsewhere to lower production costs?</li>
            <li>Can you create a more efficient manufacturing technique to reduce production time?</li>
            <li>Increase the perceived value of your products. Consider rebranding, perhaps updating
              your website, logo, and packaging in order to attract a clientele who understands that
              the pricing of your products accurately reflects the quality.</li>
            <li>Have a few less expensive items available in addition to the higher-priced items.
              These do well as quick-sell items and provide products for all types of customers.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h3><u>Does this price seem too low?</u></h3>
            If you are selling products, but just don't seem to be making a profit, or even breaking
            even, perhaps your items are priced too low.<br><br>

            Pricing your items on the lower end may draw in more customers, however, you are not
            valuing yourself as a crafter and are not implementing good business practices. Consider these
            points:<br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Crafting can be very costly. You want to be sure that you are
                charging enough to cover your cost of materials, as well as packaging, tools, electricity, gas
                and any other hidden costs that go into producing this product.</li>
              <li>Don't sell yourself short! Crafting can be extremely time-consuming, and is often a labor
                of love. If you don't set your prices to accurately reflect that you value your work, then
                no one else will value your work either! Pay yourself a healthy, fair hourly wage.</li>
              <li>Can you possibly invest in better quality raw materials, or packaging? Not only will your
                finished product look and feel nicer, you can accurately reflect these improvements in your
                pricing.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
          <h3><u>Finally, remember the law of exchange!</u></h3>
            Creating something with your hands, your time, and your resources requires an investment
            of your energy. When you provide a product or service for someone, you are loving them, helping them
            and assisting them. Energy has a flow, or currency. Currency is also the term for money. When you
            expend your energy making a product you are generating currency. It is only natural for your consumers
            to then give you another type of currency as payment: their money. It is a simple act of transference and
            exchange.<br>
            So remember, value and take pride in your work, and the benefits will flow to you!<br><br><br>
